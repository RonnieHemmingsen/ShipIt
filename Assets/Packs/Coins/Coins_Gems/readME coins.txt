2D folder:
-PREVIEWitems2D_coins.psd contains layers with items for UI (or w/e you want)

3D: texture folders contain specular files I used for marmoset turnable render,
though only handpainted textures are used for models.

Coins_Gems folder: 
-3 different coins with silver and gold textures for each.
Silver files were used for both diffuse and specular.
-6 different gems 
-1 key with iron and gold texture
